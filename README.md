    - Provides coherent and contextually relevant replies in a conversational manner.

23. **Summarizing Chat Logs**:
    - Summarizes ongoing conversations, useful for chatbots or customer support systems.

24. **Handling Multiple Languages**:
    - Luna AI supports multilingual inputs and can perform classification tasks across different languages.

25. **Contextual Understanding**:
    - Maintains context across multiple user inputs in a conversation for more accurate responses.

26. **Textual Data Filtering**:
    - Identifies and filters out irrelevant or inappropriate content from text inputs.

27. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Cleanses raw textual data by removing noise, unwanted characters, and irrelevant details.

28. **Plagiarism Detection**:
    - Checks whether a piece of text has been plagiarized or is similar to existing content on the web.

29. **Text-based Data Mining**:
    - Extracts valuable insights and patterns from large collections of text data.

30. **Speech Recognition**:
    - Converts spoken language into text, enabling voice commands and speech-based inputs.

31. **Content Moderation**:
    - Detects harmful or offensive content, useful for social media, forums, or online communities.

32. **Tagging and Labeling**:
    - Automatically tags or labels text based on predefined categories (e.g., genre, topic).

## Dataset

Luna AI requires a dataset in CSV format for training the model. The dataset must contain at least two columns: `text` and `label`.

### Example Dataset Structure

Here’s an example of the dataset format:

```csv
text,label
"I love this product!",1
"This is the worst experience.",0
```

You can find an example dataset in the `data/` directory of this repository.

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, execute the following command:

```bash
python training/train.py
```

This command will load the dataset from `data/data.csv` and initiate the training process.

### Chat Interface Usage

To run the interactive chat interface, use the following:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server, and you can interact with Luna AI via the browser.

### Saving and Loading the Model
